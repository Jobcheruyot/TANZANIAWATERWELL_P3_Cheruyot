#OVERVIEW

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict system functionality based on historical data. Multiple models were tested, with Random Forest achieving the highest accuracy (72.72%). The analysis aims to support data-driven decision-making for resource allocation, maintenance planning, and operational efficiency.

#FEATURES

Data preprocessing, including encoding categorical variables and feature scaling

Implementation of multiple classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors)

Performance evaluation using accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices

Hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance

#PROCESS

Load Data: Ensure the dataset is properly formatted and uploaded.

Preprocess Data: Run the provided scripts for handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.

Train Models: Execute the training cells to compare multiple classifiers.

Evaluate Performance: Use confusion matrices and classification reports to analyze model accuracy.

Optimize Model: Implement feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, and class balancing techniques to improve accuracy.
#RESULTS
Best Model: Random Forest (72.72% accuracy)

Challenges: Class imbalance affecting minority class predictions
