**OVERVIEW**

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict system functionality based on historical data. 
Multiple models were tested, with Random Forest achieving the highest accuracy (80%). 
The analysis aims to support data-driven decision-making for resource allocation, maintenance 
planning, and operational efficiency.

**FEATURES**

1. Data preprocessing, including encoding categorical variables and feature scaling

2. Implementation of multiple classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors)

3. Performance evaluation using accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices

4. Hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance

**PROCESS TAKEN**

1. Loaded the Data: Ensuring the dataset is properly formatted and uploaded.

2. Preprocess Data: Running the provided scripts for handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.

3. Training Models: Executing the training cells to compare multiple classifiers.

4. Evaluate Performance: Using confusion matrices and classification reports to analyze model accuracy.

5. Optimizing Models: Implemented feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, and class balancing techniques to improve accuracy.

**RESULTS**

Best Model: Random Forest (72.72% accuracy)

Challenges: Class imbalance affecting minority class predictions

**CONCLUSION**

The analysis provides valuable insights into the factors influencing system functionality. The model, particularly Random Forest (72.72% accuracy), effectively classifies functional and non-functional cases, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions. However, some misclassifications exist in the data, emphasizing the need for continuous model improvement and expert validation.

**RECOMMENDATION**
1. Use Insights for Proactive Decision-Making – Prioritize maintenance and interventions based on model predictions to prevent failures.
2. Optimize Resource Allocation – Focus efforts on high-risk areas, ensuring efficient use of manpower and budget.
3. Regular Data Updates – Continuously update and refine the dataset to improve prediction accuracy over time.
4. Combine AI with Human Expertise – Use model results alongside expert knowledge for well-rounded decision-making.
5. Monitor Model Performance – Evaluate and adjust the model periodically to adapt to changes in data patterns
